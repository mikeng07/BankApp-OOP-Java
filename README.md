# Checking Account Management System

This Java application implements a checking account management system with a graphical user interface. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles, inheritance, and GUI development in Java.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple checking accounts
- Perform transactions: deposits (checks and cash) and withdrawals
- Calculate and apply service charges based on account balance and transaction type
- Display account information and transaction history
- Save and load account data to/from files

## Key Components

- `CheckingAccount` class: Represents individual checking accounts
- `CheckOptionFrame` class: Provides the main GUI interface
- Vector data structure to store multiple accounts
- File I/O for data persistence

## How to Use

1. Run the application
2. Use the GUI to:
   - Add new accounts
   - Select existing accounts
   - Perform transactions (deposits and withdrawals)
   - View account details and transaction history
   - Save or load account data

## Technical Highlights

- Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes classes and objects to model real-world entities
- Inheritance: Likely used in the `CheckingAccount` class hierarchy (not visible in Main.java)
- GUI Development: Uses Swing components (JFrame, JTextArea, JOptionPane) for the user interface
- File Handling: Implements methods to save and load account data
- Collections: Uses Vector to store and manage multiple accounts
- Exception Handling: Implements try-catch blocks for file operations and user input

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Swing library (included in standard JDK)

This application serves as a practical example of applying various Java programming concepts in a real-world scenario of managing checking accounts.
